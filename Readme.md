# Base56 Converter

## Purpose

Base 56 is useful for short, human readable identifiers that can be used to uniquely ID more things than most people will ever use in six or seven digits.  It's an alternative to reading GUIDs, and also gives you the ability to move back and forth between base 10 autogenerated sequence IDs that are easy for databases to handle, but don't make great IDs for things like HTML.

The source can be configured to handle values bigger or smaller than Base 56.  The character set defined uses 0-9, A-Z, and a-z, skipping (OIL, and oil) since they may be confused with one and zero.  However, you can add to that set, or subtract from it just by modifying the base charset and it should work.

## Installation

Download and install with cabal install B56 --lib

## Usage

$ cd b56
$ cabal repl
*B10> runSomeTests
"Pass"

*B10> let myId = convertB10ToBx 1010101
*B10> myId
"5k5W"

*B10> let myBx = convertBxToB10 "5k5W"
*B10> myBx
Left 1010101

*B10> let myBx' = convertBxToB10' "5k5W"
*B10> myBx'
1010101

*B10> let myBadBx = convertBxToB10 "Oily"
*B10> myBadBx
Right "Cannot attempt to convert an invalid unit value in : 'Oily'. \n    The value is not in the base character set 0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz"

*B10> let mySafeBx = convertBxToB10' "Oily"
*B10> mySafeBx
-1

or

import B10.Convert as Bx
